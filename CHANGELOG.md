## 2025-10-26 - Major UI/UX Enhancements Across Dashboard

This update brings a comprehensive overhaul to the dashboard's user interface and experience, focusing on enterprise-level functionality, improved responsiveness, and polished aesthetics.

### 1. Sidebar Functionality & UX Improvements
*   **Smooth Collapsible Animation:** Implemented `framer-motion` for fluid collapse and expansion animations of sidebar width, navigation icons, and text labels. Icons now subtly scale and fade, while text intelligently appears/disappears.
*   **Consistent Icon Alignment:** All main menu icons are now consistently left-aligned when the sidebar is in its collapsed state, improving visual hierarchy.
*   **Controlled Sub-menu Behavior:** Sub-menus within accordions are prevented from expanding when the sidebar is collapsed, ensuring a cleaner interface.
*   **Dynamic Navigation Badges:** Navigation items can now display dynamic badges (e.g., counts for low stock products, pending orders), providing real-time insights directly in the menu.
*   **Role-Based Navigation Filtering:** Implemented a system to hide/show navigation items and sections based on user roles, enabling granular access control.
*   **Persistent Sidebar State:** The sidebar's collapsed/expanded state is now persisted across user sessions using `localStorage`, remembering user preferences.
*   **Vertical Separators for Sub-menus:** Added subtle vertical separators in front of sub-menu items to visually delineate them from their parent categories.
*   **Sub-menu Icons:** Icons are now displayed next to sub-menu items, enhancing visual recognition and navigation.
*   **Improved Mobile Sidebar:** Integrated a responsive off-canvas sidebar using Shadcn/ui's `Sheet` component, accessible via a hamburger menu on smaller screens, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
*   **Removed Search Functionality:** The previously implemented sidebar search functionality was removed as per user request.

### 2. General UI/UX Enhancements
*   **Blue Theme Applied:** Implemented a consistent blue theme across the application by updating CSS variables in `globals.css`.
*   **Typography Baseline:** Established a clearer typographic hierarchy and readability by adding base styles for `h1` through `h6`, `p`, `a`, `ul`, and `ol` in `globals.css`.

### 3. Page-Specific Improvements (All Dashboard Pages)
All `page.tsx` files under `src/app/dashboard/` have been refactored and enhanced with varied design approaches and extended functionality using Shadcn/ui components. Key improvements include:
*   **Analytics Pages:** Implemented diverse chart types (`LineChart`, `AreaChart`, `PieChart`, `BarChart`), `Tabs` for content organization, dynamic data representations, and filtering options.
*   **Product Pages:** Enhanced tables with bulk actions, selection checkboxes, image thumbnails, and a unified dialog for product creation/editing.
*   **Orders Pages:** Improved tables with search, filtering, pagination, bulk actions, and integrated invoice views.
*   **Customers Page:** Enhanced customer tables with search, filtering by segments, and integrated actions.
*   **Settings Pages:** Structured various settings (Workspace, Billing, Permissions, Team) using `Card` components, `Field` forms, `Switch` toggles, `Select` inputs, and interactive tables for management.
*   **Automation Pages (Webhooks, Workflows, API Keys, Integrations):** Designed with user-friendly interfaces for managing configurations, statuses, and logs, utilizing tables, cards, dialogs, and dynamic controls.
*   **Admin Pages (Tenants, Logs, Settings):** Provided robust administration interfaces with search, filtering, pagination, and direct actions for managing tenants, viewing system logs, and configuring platform-wide settings.

### 4. Bug Fixes
*   Resolved `ReferenceError: motion is not defined` in `src/components/sidebar.tsx` by correcting import order.
*   Resolved multiple `Ecmascript file had an error` due to duplicate import statements (`Button`, `Badge`) by cleaning up import blocks in `src/components/header.tsx` and `src/components/sidebar.tsx`.
*   Resolved "logout not working" by correctly integrating Clerk's `signOut` functionality into the custom user dropdown menu in `src/components/header.tsx`.
*   Corrected a build error in `src/app/dashboard/products/import-export/page.tsx` related to a syntax error in a `disabled` prop.
